# Algorithm Repository

Welcome to the **Algorithm Repository**! ðŸŽ‰ This repository is a personal study space dedicated to organizing essential algorithms, implemented in multiple programming languages, as part of my computer science learning journey.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
Each algorithm is organized into its own folder, containing implementations in various programming languages. The structure is as follows:

```
algorithm/
â”œâ”€â”€ gcd/        # Euclidean Algorithm (Greatest Common Divisor)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gcd.py   # Python implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gcd.c    # C implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gcd.cpp  # C++ implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gcd.java # Java implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ base_conversion/  # N-base Conversion
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base_conversion.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base_conversion.c
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base_conversion.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base_conversion.java
â””â”€â”€ ...         # More algorithms to come
```

## ðŸ“œ Algorithms Included
### 1. Euclidean Algorithm
Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using repeated division.

### 2. N-base Conversion
Converts numbers between different bases (e.g., binary, decimal, hexadecimal).

More algorithms will be added as I progress in my studies. ðŸš€
